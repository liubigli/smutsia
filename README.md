In this repository I report all the code developed for experiments during the writing of my thesis manuscript.

## TODO LIST
Here we report a list of things to do by argument:

### General
* [ ] Import code from other repositories: (yaourt, SST, crispy, etc) 
* [ ] Develop a code to test and measure results obtained during experiments (e.g. plot Prec/Recall Curve or Confusion Matrix )
#
## Ground Detection
Approaches to test:

1. &lambda;-flat-zones
2. U-Net on spherical images or BEV
3. RANSAC


#### \lambda-flat zones
* [ ] 3D graph: Use the normals and z values
   * [ ] Find a merge strategy once segmented the graph 

* [ ] Using the code from Bea

#### U-Net
* [ ] Integrate experiments done on Crispy-Eureka

#### RANSAC
* [ ] Do some tests with implemented method in Pyntcloud
